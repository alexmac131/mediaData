<p>
MediaSearch at first was a means of finding any video content media we had on our network Lan . My partner Mary kept downloading videos from a commercial site and using up bandwidth limits.  This of course was not a front and pressing issue having just moved in to our first home together with so many other chores to do.

The importance of this changed when during a coding challenge for employment I could not even write the most basic script in J query. Having a need to learn, having a need at home and having the means to building something useful for both birthed this project.

The idea project should allow searched based on entering characters and having an auto complete display of results without any database calls.  I do this by pre-building daily new lists of files for the use by the J query autocomplete  - this works very nice as the master list is loaded into the browser as page data and never have to do an exterior query during the session making it lightening fast searches.
