Introduction
===
I have a large amount of personal content at home collected from various sources and there is a organize, quantify and sort my content.  Searching click by click on 20 TB of disk at home makes for tedious time and certainly result in content being "lost" but really not so. In the times of bill per bit and no unlimited downloading it is good to know you already have a 1 Gig movie already.
